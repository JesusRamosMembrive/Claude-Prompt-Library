"""
Generate detailed assessment report for manual review.

This script generates a comprehensive stage assessment report combining:
1. Visual project tree structure
2. Automated stage detection metrics
3. Instructions for Claude Code to perform deep analysis

The output is formatted as Markdown for easy copy-paste into Claude Code
or documentation. It's designed for borderline cases where automated
detection needs human verification.

Usage:
    python claude_assess.py <project-path>

Output:
    Markdown-formatted report to stdout containing:
    - Project structure tree (rendered natively, depth 3)
    - Automated assessment results (using assess_stage module)
    - Analysis instructions for Claude Code
    - Decision criteria for Stage 2 vs Stage 3 borderline cases

Dependencies:
    - assess_stage.py (must be in same directory)

Notes:
    - Ignores common noise (.venv, node_modules, .git, etc.)
    - Focuses on Stage 2/3 distinction (most common ambiguity)
    - Provides specific guidance for human/AI review
    - Output can be piped to file or clipboard

## Instructions for Claude Code

Analyze this project and determine the appropriate development stage:

1. **Review Structure**: Look at directory organization, file names, patterns
2. **Assess Complexity**: Consider LOC, file count, architecture layers
3. **Identify Patterns**: Look for service layers, repositories, factories, etc.
4. **Evaluate Quality**: Are files too large? Is structure appropriate?

### Decision Criteria:

**Stage 2 (Late):**
- 15-20 files, 2000-3000 LOC
- 2-3 architectural layers
- 1-2 simple patterns
- Files might be large but not overly complex
- Good for this stage: keep patterns simple

**Stage 3 (Early):**
- 15-25 files, 3000-6000 LOC  
- 3-4 architectural layers
- Multiple patterns emerging
- Might benefit from more splitting
- Good for this stage: patterns are appropriate

### Your Assessment:

Please provide:
- **Recommended Stage**: 2 (Late) or 3 (Early)
- **Confidence**: High/Medium/Low
- **Key Evidence**: What in the structure supports this?
- **Specific Recommendations**: Should files be split? Patterns needed? Any refactoring?
- **Current State**: What's working well? What needs attention?

Consider that Stage 2 → Stage 3 is gradual. If borderline, choose based on:
- **Choose Stage 2 if**: Structure works, no pain points, patterns not needed yet
- **Choose Stage 3 if**: Files are large, would benefit from patterns, architecture needed
