# Stage-Aware Development Framework

**Prevent over-engineering. Guide evolution. Stay in control.**

A methodology and toolset for evolutionary software development with Claude Code. Automatically detects your project's maturity and configures Claude Code to work within appropriate constraints.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

When developing with AI assistants like Claude Code:
- ✗ Too easy to over-engineer early prototypes
- ✗ AI suggests enterprise patterns for 100-line scripts
- ✗ Hard to maintain "start simple" discipline
- ✗ Context loss between sessions breaks momentum

## 💡 The Solution

**Stage-Aware Development Framework** enforces evolutionary development through:

1. **Automatic Stage Detection** - Analyzes codebase and recommends Stage 1/2/3
2. **Stage-Specific Rules** - Prevents complexity until justified
3. **Specialized Subagents** - Architect, implementer, reviewer that understand stage context
4. **Session Continuity** - Tracking files preserve decisions and progress

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### New Project

```bash
python init_project.py my-new-project
cd my-new-project
```

Creates `.claude/` with stage rules, subagents, and tracking files.

### Existing Project

```bash
python init_project.py --existing /path/to/project
```

Adds framework + **auto-detects stage** + updates tracking.

### Just Check Stage

```bash
python init_project.py --detect-only /path/to/project
```

Analyzes project without modifying anything.

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Stage Detection

Analyzes your codebase:
- File count & lines of code
- Design patterns present
- Architecture complexity
- Directory structure

**Example output:**
```
📊 Recommended Stage: 2
✅ Confidence: HIGH

📈 Metrics:
  - Files: 15
  - LOC: ~2500
  - Patterns: Repository, Service

💡 Reasoning:
  • Medium codebase (15 files, ~2500 LOC)
  • Basic architecture: 3 layers
  • 📍 Mid Stage 2 - structure emerging
```

### 2. Stage Rules

Projects get `.claude/02-stageX-rules.md` files that Claude Code enforces:

**Stage 1 (Prototyping):**
- One file preferred
- No abstractions
- Hardcoded values OK
- Prove concept works

**Stage 2 (Structuring):**
- Multiple files when helpful
- Simple classes allowed
- 1-2 patterns max
- Add structure for real pain

**Stage 3 (Production):**
- Patterns appropriate
- Architecture matters
- Optimization justified
- Design for scale

### 3. Specialized Subagents

Four agents understand stage context:

- **architect** - Designs architecture appropriate for stage
- **implementer** - Writes code enforcing stage rules
- **code-reviewer** - Validates complexity matches stage
- **stage-keeper** - Documents framework itself

### 4. Session Tracking

Progress tracked in `.claude/01-current-phase.md`:
- What was implemented
- Decisions made and why
- What was deferred
- Next steps

Prevents context loss between Claude Code sessions.

## 🎓 Core Philosophy

### YAGNI with Evidence

**You Aren't Gonna Need It** - Until you prove you do.

- Stage 1: Prove the concept
- Stage 2: Add structure when refactoring hurts
- Stage 3: Scale when usage demands it

### Evolutionary Architecture

Don't design for scale at the start. Design to evolve easily.

### Maintain Control

AI executes. Human decides. Framework enforces.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Individual Developers

Stop over-engineering side projects. Start simple, evolve with evidence.

### For Teams

Consistent development standards. Everyone works at appropriate complexity level.

### For Prototypes

Force simplicity. Prevent "production-ready" code for throwaway experiments.

### For Existing Projects

Assess current state. Get recommendation. Follow appropriate rules going forward.

## 🧪 Example: Stage Detection in Action

**Empty project → Stage 1:**
```bash
python init_project.py --existing my-new-idea
# Detected Stage 1 (0 files)
# Rule: One file, no abstractions
```

**After prototyping → Stage 2:**
```bash
python assess_stage.py my-new-idea
# Detected Stage 2 (8 files, 1200 LOC)
# Rule: Multiple files OK, 1-2 patterns
```

**In production → Stage 3:**
```bash
python assess_stage.py my-production-app
# Detected Stage 3 (35 files, 6000 LOC)
# Rule: Patterns appropriate, architect for scale
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

**Runtime:**
- Python 3.10+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)

**Optional:**
- Claude Code CLI (`claude`) - For CLAUDE.md generation
- `tree` command - For project visualization

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stage-aware-framework
cd stage-aware-framework

# Use directly (no installation needed)
python init_project.py my-project
```

---

## 🔍 How Stage Detection Works

### Detection Algorithm

```python
# Stage 1: Prototyping
if files <= 3 and loc < 500:
    stage = 1

# Stage 2: Structuring
elif files <= 20 and loc < 3000 and patterns <= 3:
    stage = 2

# Stage 3: Production
else:
    stage = 3
```

Plus analysis of:
- Design patterns (Factory, Repository, Service, etc.)
- Architecture layers (models, services, controllers, etc.)
- Directory structure complexity

### Confidence Levels

- **High** - Clear indicators, trust the recommendation
- **Medium** - Borderline, manual review recommended
- **Low** - Conflicting signals, definitely review manually

## 🤝 Philosophy in Practice

### Real Example: API Development

**Week 1 (Stage 1):**
```python
# main.py - 150 lines
# All in one file, hardcoded, works
```

**Week 3 (Stage 2 - pain felt):**
```
api/
  routes.py      # Routes separated
  handlers.py    # Logic extracted
  models.py      # Data structures
  main.py        # Entry point
```

**Month 3 (Stage 3 - scale needed):**
```
api/
  routes/        # Route modules
  services/      # Business logic
  models/        # Data layer
  middleware/    # Cross-cutting
  tests/         # Comprehensive
```

**The framework prevents jumping to Month 3 structure in Week 1.**

## 📖 Background

This framework emerged from experience developing with Claude Code and other AI assistants.

**The pattern:** AI is incredibly helpful but tends toward over-engineering. It's easier to suggest a Repository pattern than to question if it's needed.

**The solution:** Explicit stage rules that AI must follow. Automatic detection of project maturity. Specialized subagents that understand context.

**The result:** Better software, faster. Simple when simple suffices. Complex when complexity is justified.

2. **Initialize a project** with `init_project.py`
3. **Check stage** of existing projects
4. **Use subagents** for stage-appropriate guidance
5. **Re-assess** after major changes

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Do I have to follow the stages strictly?**
A: No. They're guides, not rules. Adapt to your context.

**Q: Can I customize stage rules?**
A: Yes. Edit `.claude/02-stageX-rules.md` files directly.

**Q: What if stage detection is wrong?**
A: Manual override: edit `01-current-phase.md` directly.

**Q: Does this work without Claude Code?**
A: Yes. The framework works with any AI assistant or human development.

**Q: What about non-Python projects?**
A: Fully supported. Detection works for .js, .ts, .java, .go, .rs, etc.
